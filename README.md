Handwritten Digit Classifier API
This project provides a simple Flask API for classifying handwritten digits using a pre-trained TensorFlow Keras model.

## ‚ú® Features
Handwritten Digit Classification: Classifies grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9).
Flask API: Exposes a RESTful endpoint for submitting images and receiving predictions.
TensorFlow Keras Model: Utilizes a pre-trained nn.h5 model for predictions.
Image Preprocessing: Automatically transforms input images to the required 28x28 grayscale format.


## üõ†Ô∏è Setup
Prerequisites
  requirements.txt

## üöÄ Usage
Run the Flask application:

Bash

python app.py
The API will become available at http://127.0.0.1:5001.

Send a POST request with an image:
You can use curl or Postman to send your image file.

Example using curl:

Bash

curl -X POST -F "file=@path/to/your/image.png" http://127.0.0.1:5001/

Replace path/to/your/image.png with the actual path to your handwritten digit image. The image should be a grayscale image.


## üîå API Endpoint
POST /
Description: Accepts a handwritten digit image and returns the predicted digit.
Request Body: multipart/form-data with a field named file containing the image.
Responses:
200 OK:
JSON

{"prediction": 7}
(Returns the predicted digit as an integer)
400 Bad Request:
JSON

{"error": "no file"}
(If no file is provided in the request)
500 Internal Server Error:
JSON

{"error": "Error message"}
(For other server-side errors, including issues during image processing or prediction)
GET /
Description: A simple health check endpoint.
Response: 200 OK with the text "OK".


## üß† Model
The nn.h5 model is expected to be a pre-trained TensorFlow Keras model capable of classifying 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits into 10 classes (0-9). If you don't have one, you'll need to train or acquire a suitable model.


## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment to Google Cloud Run
Follow these steps to deploy your Flask application as a containerized service on Google Cloud Run.

1. Setup Google Cloud Project
Create a new Google Cloud Project: If you don't have one, create a new project via the Google Cloud Console.
Activate APIs: In your new project, activate the following APIs:
Cloud Run API
Cloud Build API
2. Install and Initialize Google Cloud SDK
Follow the official documentation to install and initialize the Google Cloud SDK on your local machine:
Install Google Cloud SDK
Once installed, initialize it with your project:
Bash

gcloud init

Follow the prompts to select your project.
3. Dockerfile, requirements.txt, and .dockerignore
To containerize your application, you'll need these files in your project root. Refer to the Google Cloud Run quickstart guide on containerizing for detailed instructions.

Dockerfile: Defines how your application is built into a Docker image.
requirements.txt: Lists all Python dependencies (as created in the "Installation" section above).
.dockerignore: Specifies files and directories to exclude from the Docker build context.
